To turn your prd.md (Product Requirements Document) into an actual Shopify theme, you’ll need to follow a structured development process. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you move from requirements to a working Shopify theme:
1. Break Down the PRD into Tasks
Go through each feature and requirement in your prd.md.
Create a checklist or use a project management tool (like Trello, GitHub Issues, or Notion) to track each feature as a task (e.g., “Implement multiple product views”, “Add lifestyle mockups”, “Create size guide section”, etc.).
2. Set Up Your Development Environment
Install Shopify CLI if you haven’t already.
Log in to your Shopify Partner account and create a development store.
Use the CLI to create a new theme or clone your existing starter theme:

3. Map PRD Features to Shopify Theme Files
Templates: Product, collection, index, cart, etc.
Sections: Hero, featured products, reviews, banners, etc.
Snippets: Buttons, badges, icons, etc.
Assets: CSS, JS, images, icons.
Locales: For translations and multi-language support.
Config: Theme settings for color palette, typography, etc.
4. Start Building Feature by Feature
For each requirement in your PRD, decide which file(s) it belongs in.
Example mapping:
Multiple Product Views: sections/main-product.liquid
Lifestyle Mockups: sections/main-product.liquid or a custom section
Size Guide: snippets/size-guide.liquid and link in product template
Smart Search Bar: sections/header.liquid and supporting JS
Trust Badges: snippets/trust-badges.liquid
Reviews: Integrate with a reviews app or custom section/snippet
5. Use Theme Settings for Customization
In config/settings_schema.json, add settings for colors, fonts, logo, etc., as described in your PRD.
6. Test Responsiveness and Performance
Use Shopify’s preview and device emulation tools.
Optimize images and code for speed.
7. Iterate and Review
Check off each PRD requirement as you implement it.
Test with real products and data in your development store.
8. Prepare for Launch
When all requirements are met, push your theme to your Shopify store:
Apply
Test thoroughly before publishing.
Example: Turning a PRD Feature into Theme Code
PRD Feature: F.1.1 Multiple Product Views: Each product page must display multiple high-resolution images showing the product from various angles.
How to Implement:
Edit sections/main-product.liquid (or similar) to loop through product.images and display them in a gallery or slider.
Use a library like Flickity or Shopify’s built-in image gallery.
